# Machine Learning Video Classifier

This is the code for the FakeTicTacToe programm done with machine learning, p5.js and KNN for School of Machine project.

This is how you train your machine throught the camera with your own examples of >O and >I (cannot make an X with one hand)
and the machine recognizes your inputs by classifying them in two categories, using a json file for the dataset.


You need to execute the code inside the folder's terminal with the command:

For python version 2: 

``` python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000```

For python version 3:

```python3 -m http.server```

"8000" is the port number where you can decide it or you can do it by default.

Then, you should open a web browser and write on the URL localhost:port_number, in this case: **localhost:8000**.
